</div>

If you want to bypass to guided input you can pass in 3 arguments and it will run from there
ex.```currency [baseCurrency] [exchangeToCurrency] [amountBeingExchanged]```
so a valid use case would be ```currency USD EUR 12.35```


## Encryption & Decryption

A wrapper for openssl that allows for quickly encrypting and decrypting files

```bash
crypt -e [original file] [encrypted file] # encrypts files
crypt -d [encrypted file] [output file] # decrypts files
```
#### Encryption Details
* Uses AES 256 level encryption
* Key is salted before creation
* Password is never in plain text, and OpenSSL generates key based on password
* Data is encrypted in Base64, so it can be used as plain text in an email. (Not usually necessary if attached as a file)

**Tested With**  .pdf, .txt, .docx, .doc, .png, .jpeg

**CAUTION**  Make sure to use different filenames, otherwise your file will be overwritten!
