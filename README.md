##### A collection of small bash scripts for heavy terminal users with no dependencies

![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/alexanderepstein/Bash-Snippets.svg) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/a4bf023a3d0d499abc9d2bf14b296a14)](https://www.codacy.com/app/alexanderepstein/Bash-Snippets?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=alexanderepstein/Bash-Snippets&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexanderepstein/Bash-Snippets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexanderepstein/Bash-Snippets) ![platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-OSX%2C%20Linux%20%26%20Windows-blue.svg)  [![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg?style=plastic)]()



### All of these scripts have been heavily tested on macOS and Linux
### Most of these scripts have been tested on Windows 10 and the official developer bash instance. Does not work with Cygwin or Mysys2.

#### Looking for maintainers: I have been and probably will forever be too busy to maintain this properly on my own. I am looking for a few others to help out, if you want to be a maintainer either email me or raise an issue. I will probably only accept maintainers who have made a few contributions (no matter how small) and seem to understand the vision of this project.

<summary>Crypt</summary>

A wrapper for openssl that allows for quickly encrypting and decrypting files

```bash

```
#### Encryption Details
* Uses AES 256 level encryption
* Key is salted before creation
* Password is never in plain text, and OpenSSL generates key based on password
* Encrypted data is encoded in Base64, so it can be used as plain text in an email. (Not usually necessary if attached as a file)

**Tested With**  .pdf, .txt, .docx, .doc, .png, .jpeg

**CAUTION**  Make sure to use different filenames, otherwise your file will be overwritten!

<summary>Siteciphers</summary>

Check which ciphers are enabled / disabled for a given https site.

Sometimes ciphers are deemed vulnerable, so when you are changing configuration, this can be used to confirm that the cipher truly is disabled.

Some browsers (For example old versions of IE) don't support some of the newer ciphers, which would be a good example of when a SysAdmin would need a list of currently supported ciphers so that changes can be made.
