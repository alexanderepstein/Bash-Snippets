## Cloudup

A tool that facilitates backing up github repositories to bitbucket

If you have ever felt the fear of the github unicorn this could be your savior

Furthermore you can backup the repositories of any github user to your bitbucket.

Backup all github repositories of the designated user at once with the -a option.
Or run it with no flags and backup individual repositories.

## Siteciphers

Check which ciphers are enabled / disabled for a given https site.

Sometimes ciphers are deemed vulnerable, so when you are changing configuration, this can be used to confirm that the cipher truly is disabled.

Some browsers (For example old versions of IE) don't support some of the newer ciphers, which would be a good example of when a SysAdmin would need a list of currently supported ciphers so that changes can be made.

## Crypt

A wrapper for openssl that allows for quickly encrypting and decrypting files

```bash
crypt -e [original file] [encrypted file] # encrypts files
crypt -d [encrypted file] [output file] # decrypts files
```
#### Encryption Details
* Uses AES 256 level encryption
* Key is salted before creation
* Password is never in plain text, and OpenSSL generates key based on password
* Encrypted data is encoded in Base64, so it can be used as plain text in an email. (Not usually necessary if attached as a file)

**Tested With**  .pdf, .txt, .docx, .doc, .png, .jpeg

**CAUTION**  Make sure to use different filenames, otherwise your file will be overwritten!
