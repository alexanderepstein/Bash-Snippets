<details>
<summary>Crypt</summary>

A wrapper for openssl that allows for quickly encrypting and decrypting files

```bash
crypt -e [original file] [encrypted file] # encrypts files
crypt -d [encrypted file] [output file] # decrypts files
```
#### Encryption Details
* Uses AES 256 level encryption
* Key is salted before creation
* Password is never in plain text, and OpenSSL generates key based on password
* Encrypted data is encoded in Base64, so it can be used as plain text in an email. (Not usually necessary if attached as a file)

**Tested With**  .pdf, .txt, .docx, .doc, .png, .jpeg

**CAUTION**  Make sure to use different filenames, otherwise your file will be overwritten!

<div align="center">

<img max-height="500px" max-width="505px" src="https://github.com/alexanderepstein/Bash-Snippets/blob/master/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency.png?raw=true">

</div>

Run `cryptocurrency` and you'll be guided through providing three arguments.  
1. Base currency, i.e. `BTC`
2. Target currency, i.e. `USD`
3. Amount, i.e. `12.35`

If you want to bypass the guided input you can pass in 3 arguments and it will run from there, i.e.    
```bash
cryptocurrency [baseCurrency] [exchangeToCurrency] [amountBeingExchanged]
```  
A valid use case would be:  
```bash
cryptocurrency BTC USD 12.35
```

<summary>Siteciphers</summary>

Check which ciphers are enabled / disabled for a given https site.

Sometimes ciphers are deemed vulnerable, so when you are changing configuration, this can be used to confirm that the cipher truly is disabled.

Some browsers (For example old versions of IE) don't support some of the newer ciphers, which would be a good example of when a SysAdmin would need a list of currently supported ciphers so that changes can be made.
